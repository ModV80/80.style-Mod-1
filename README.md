# 80.style
 
[80.style](https://80.style/) is the home of **Alessandro Ghignola** (aka Alex, Furrball) and his creations. He has released the frontend's source code in the Public Domain and, since he doesn't use git, this repository aims to provide an up-to-date mirror of his codebase.

Here the community is free to create forks, open issues, play around with the code and even propose changes that might be considered by Alex for inclusion in the website.

## The website at a glance

There is more information on the actual website, of course, but to break down the content of this repo, we have:
* A 3D engine written entirely in JavaScript, the **Spectrum Engine**, and a virtual space called **The Array**. 
* A user interface for the site's blogging platform.
* 17 different themes based on the aesthetics of older hardware, like the Commodore 64 or vacuum fluorescent displays.

Please note that the version of The Array here presented is not populated by any models because they reside on the server side.
